# Media

A temporary plugin to allow exposing static media. Will become more.

## Goals

- API methods for adding, removing, listing, and usage-tracking media.

- Dashboard page to allow for configuring media handlers and cleaning up unused media.

- Elements-Base integration, to allow for uploading images directly into Image Elements, etc.

- Media Handlers API, which transform media elements when uploaded, such as compressing JPEGs, converting to WebP, DOCX to PDF, etc.
